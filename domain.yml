  utter_corona_intro:
  - text: Coronaviruses are a group of related viruses that cause diseases in mammals
      and birds. In humans, coronaviruses cause respiratory tract infections that
      can be mild, such as some cases of the common cold (among other possible causes,
      predominantly rhinoviruses), and others that can be more fatal, such as SARS
      and COVID-19.
  utter_corona_spread:
  - text: "This virus was first detected in Wuhan City, Hubei Province, China. The\
      \ first infections were linked to a live animal market, but the virus is now\
      \ spreading from person-to-person. It’s important to note that person-to-person\
      \ spread can happen on a continuum. Some viruses are highly contagious (like\
      \ measles), while other viruses are less so. The virus that causes COVID-19\
      \ is spreading from person-to-person and it is even Air Borne virus as well.\
      \ Someone who is actively sick with COVID-19 can spread the illness to others.\
      \ That is why we recommend that these patients be isolated either in the hospital\
      \ or at home (depending on how sick they are) until they are better and no longer\
      \ pose a risk of infecting others.\nHow long someone is actively sick can vary\
      \ so the decision on when to release someone from isolation is made on a case-by-case\
      \ basis in consultation with doctors, infection prevention and control experts,\
      \ and public health officials and involves considering specifics of each situation\
      \ including disease severity, illness signs and symptoms, and results of laboratory\
      \ testing for that patient.\nThe virus that causes COVID-19 seems to be spreading\
      \ easily and sustainably in the community (“community spread”) in some affected\
      \ geographic areas. Community spread means people have been infected with the\
      \ virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became\
      \ infected."
  utter_corona_food_spread:
  - text: Coronaviruses are generally thought to be spread from person-to-person through
      respiratory droplets and it is also air borne according to WHO. Before preparing
      or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water
      for 20 seconds for general food safety. Throughout the day wash your hands after
      blowing your nose, coughing or sneezing, or going to the bathroom.
  utter_warm_weather:
  - text: It is not yet known whether weather and temperature impact the spread of
      COVID-19. Some other viruses, like the common cold and flu, spread more during
      cold weather months but that does not mean it is impossible to become sick with
      these viruses during other months.  At this time, it is not known whether the
      spread of COVID-19 will decrease when weather becomes warmer.  There is much
      more to learn about the transmissibility, severity, and other features associated
      with COVID-19 and investigations are ongoing.
  utter_high_risk:
  - text: Older adults and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions
      may be at higher risk for more serious complications from COVID-19. These people
      who may be at higher risk of getting very sick from this illness, includes;
      Older adults, People who have serious underlying medical conditions like...
      Heart disease, Diabetes, Lung disease.
  utter_corona_symptoms:
  - text: "Most common symptoms include;\n1) fever\n2) dry cough\n3) tiredness\nLess\
      \ common symptoms include\n1) aches and pain\n2) sore throat\n3) diarrhoea\n\
      4) conjunctivitis\n5) headache\n6) loss of taste or smell\n7) a rash on skin,\
      \ or discolouration of fingers or toes.\nSerious symptoms include\n1) difficulty\
      \ breathing or shortness of breath\n2) chest pain or pressure and\n3) loss of\
      \ speech or movement.\nSeek immediate medical attention if you have serious\
      \ symptoms.\nAlways call before visiting your doctor or health facility.\nPeople\
      \ with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms\
      \ at home.\nOn average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with\
      \ the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days."

  utter_alpha_variant:
  - text: "ALPHA: In December 2020, British researchers discovered that a new variant was sweeping through their country.\n\ 
      \ When it arrived in other countries, the variant, now known as Alpha, tended to become more common in its\n\ 
      \ new homes as well. By April 2020, it had become the dominant variant in the United States, and it has remained \
      so ever since."

      BETA: Seychelles, which has vaccinated a greater proportion of its people than any other nation, 
      said genetic sequencing of samples shows that the so-called Beta variant, first discovered in South 
      Africa last year, is behind a surge in cases.

      GAMMA: A mutation in the Gamma variant (P1) of coronavirus is linked to increased mortality, 
      a Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and MIT researchers said on Wednesday.
      The mutation also carries greater transmissibility, higher infection rates, and increased 
      pathogenicity, showed the study detailed in the journal Genetic Epidemiology.
      The findings were based on genome-wide association studies (GWAS) methodology, which 
      analysed whole-genome sequencing data of SARS-CoV-2 mutations and COVID-19 mortality data. 
      In September 2020, the team looked for links between each mutation of the SARS-CoV-2 virus's 
      single-stranded RNA and mortality in 7,548 COVID-19 patients in Brazil.
      The researchers found one mutation—at locus 25,088bp in the virus's genome—that alters the spike protein 
      and was linked to a significant increase in mortality in COVID-19 patients. The team flagged the variant
      with this mutation, which was later identified as part of P1.

      DELTA: After creating widespead mahyem in India for almost 2 months
      delta variant is proven to be very dangerous. as there are also
      vaccination drives are going on, infections are less but the 
      India variant also called as delta variant has already killed 3.9 million people.
